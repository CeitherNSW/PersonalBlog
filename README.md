# PersonalBlog
This is a personal blog project that I am working on. It is a simple blog that allows myself to create, read, update, and delete posts. Allow other users to make comment and tick like or dislike for each post. The blog is built using React and * not decided *. The blog is still a work in progress and I am constantly adding new features and improving the design.
